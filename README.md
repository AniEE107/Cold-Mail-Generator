# ðŸ“§Cold-Mail-Generator
AI-Powered Personalized Email Generation

# Introduction
The Cold Mail Generator is an intelligent tool designed to assist in creating highly personalized and effective cold emails using advanced Generative AI capabilities. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Groq API and potentially a vector database for contextual understanding, this project aims to streamline the outreach process for sales, marketing, and networking.

# Features
AI-Powered Email Generation: Craft compelling and tailored cold emails with the assistance of a powerful LLM.
Fast LLM Inference: Utilizes Groq for rapid processing and quick response times from the AI models.
Modular Codebase: Organized Python scripts (main.py, my_chains.py, portfolio.py, utils.py) for clarity and maintainability.
Interactive Development: Jupyter notebooks provided for experimenting with core AI components and workflows.

# File Structure
Project is organized as follows:
